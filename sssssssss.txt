<h2>
Roblox is a game creation platform which allows players to create their own games using its proprietary engine, Roblox Studio.<br> 
Games are coded under an object oriented programming system utilizing the programming language Lua to manipulate the environment of the game.<br> 
[3] Users are able to create game passes, which are purchasable content through one-time purchases, as well as microtransactions through developer products.<br> 
 Developers on the site exchange Robux earned from various products on their games into real world currency through the Developer Exchange system.<br> 
[4] A percentage of the revenue from purchases is split between the developer and Roblox.[5][6]<br>

selecting predefined messages from a menu.[14] In August, Roblox added Builders Club, a premium membership, and applied server improvements.[15]<br> 

In December 2011, Roblox held their first Hack Week, an annual event where Roblox developers work on innovative outside-the-box ideas for new developments <br> 
to present to the company.[16][17]<br>
